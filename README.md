- Password encryption using BCrypt
- Email handling with Mailtrap (to be replaced with a production-ready solution)
- Organized project structure following Spring Boot best practices
- JSON-based request and response format
- Centralized database access layer with MySQL

## Technologies Used

- Java 17+
- Spring Boot
